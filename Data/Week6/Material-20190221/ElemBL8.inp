TITLE: Validating Hypothesized Causal Structure for Calibration Group
       Modified Baseline model (Byrne 2012, p. 268-)
       Combined F2 and F3, re-numbered the factors
       Added F8 ON F2
       Added EE1 WITH EE2
       Deleted n.s. params: F7 ON F6, F8 ON F4, F10 ON F2, F11 ON F1, F11 ON F8
       Removed factors F1 and F6 and their items (no specified relations)!
       Renamed factors, deleted items from USEVARS, "revised model" (Byrne, p.275)
       Fine-tuning: remove unwanted parameter F9 WITH F6 (see p.272, 278).
